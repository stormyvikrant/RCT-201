## Debugging

A way of finding errors.

### What is Debugging?

Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as 'bugs') in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash.

### Why do we need Debugging?

To prevent incorrect operation of software or system, debugging is used to find and resolve bugs or defects.

### How to debug?

We log the information and go back and front from vscode to the browser to see if the information flowing is correct.

### What is the right way of debugging?

Using browser features to debug the front-end and using vscode features to debug the backend.

### Browser Debugging

1. Adding breakpoints
2. go next
3. go over
4. go inside
5. fall outside
6. disable breakpoints for a dry run

### VS Code debugging

1. debugger
2. console.log
3. console.time and console.timeEnd
